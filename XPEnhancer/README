XPEnhancer - an easy to use bukkit-plugin that lets you use your XP for something good
Author: Maelwedd ( maelwedd@starstruct.org )

Installation:

Copy the jar file to your CraftBukkit installation's plugin folder.

Usage:

    * Permissions support:
    		* xpenhancer.create for creating stores in-game
    		* xpenhancer.use for using stores
    * Goods must be created before adding stores in-game! Default config will be created on first run.
    * To create a store in-game:
    		* Place a stone-button, this will be the store
    		* Right click button with a stick, this will initiate the creation
    		* Right click button with the material defined as "id" in the desired goods (config.yml)
    		* (Repeat above step if you used the wrong material)
    		* Right click with a stick again to activate store 
    		* Tips: You will be notified when something worked.
    		* Note: There is no method for deleting a store in-game; simply destroying the button will NOT work 
	* To use a store:
			* Right click the button to get instructions
			* Right click the button with object as described in instructions to buy (as defined in use_id in config.yml)
			* If you bought a block, the block you used will be replaced with the one you bought
			* If you bought an entity, the block you used may be changed, and to "cash in" your entity, simply _left click_ on the desired location with a stick
			* Note: If you do not have enough XP the transaction will be cancelled
